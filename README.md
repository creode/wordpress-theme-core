# WordPress Theme Core
This is the core of the WordPress theme. It contains the basic structure of the theme boilerplate and the necessary files to assist in the development of the theme.

## Structure
The core is divided into the following directories:
- **includes** - Contains any PHP classes or code to be used within the theme.
- **js** - Any javascript classes or helper functions to be included within the theme.
- **boot.php** - The main entrypoint to the theme core that bootstraps the theme.
